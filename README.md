## üìä How It Works

### 1. Data Collection
- Scrapes 12 subreddits for posts from the last 3 days
- Filters posts containing iOS/app-related keywords
- Collects metadata: upvotes, comments, subreddit, etc.

### 2. Intelligent Scoring
Each post gets a relevance score based on:

- **Comments** (20%): Engagement indicates interest
- **Keyword Matches** (25%): More relevant keywords = higher score
- **Recency** (15%): Newer posts prioritized
- **Subreddit Relevance** (10%): r/AppIdeas scores higher than r/iPhone

### 3. AI Processing
GPT-4o-mini analyzes each post and generates:
- Problem statement
